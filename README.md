## To-Do List Application

### Project Description

The To-Do List is a task management application built using Vite and TypeScript. This project demonstrates the use of key concepts and tools in the React ecosystem, such as the `useContext`, `useState`, and `useRef` hooks, as well as the implementation of data models in TypeScript.

### Technologies

- **Vite**: A super-fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity.
- **React**: A popular library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: Including `useContext` for state management, `useState` for managing component state, and `useRef` for referencing DOM elements or keeping persistent values across renders.

### Features

- **Task Management**: Add, remove, and manage tasks efficiently.
- **Context API**: Utilizes React's Context API to manage global state.
- **Type Safety**: Leverages TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve code reliability.

### Data Model

The application uses a `Task` class to represent individual tasks. Each task has a unique identifier and a text description, ensuring a consistent structure and type safety throughout the application.

### Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

### Usage
